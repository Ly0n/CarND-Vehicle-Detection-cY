# Vehicle Detection with Enhanced Optical Flow Outlier Filter

**Tobias Augspurger for CarND**

> __**The optical flow on a detected vehicle needs to be equal distibuted.**__ 

This is my final project for the CarND Term 1. The goal is to detect car in a video stream. This is done by and SVC classifier with multiple image features. Densed Optical Flow is later on used to removed outlier by the variance of the pixel angle and speed.

Please check my Jupyter Notebook for more information.
